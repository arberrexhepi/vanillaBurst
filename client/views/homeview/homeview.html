    <ul>
        <li>A standalone or plugin solution.</li>
        <li>Ensures your required files are ready for the function, DOM, and server you are interacting with.</li>
        <li>Control the behaviour of an existing JS project or create your own entirely!</li>
        <li>Builds and prepares the project as [vanillaApp].</li>
        <li>No additional helper functions needed if all you need is JS files promised exactly where you need them.
        </li>
        <li>Never wonder why your clicks aren't firing again, especially in something like Wordpress!</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>What else can vanillaBurst do?</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Packs and load balances a project's files by endpoint i.e: ?burst=home.</li>
        <li>Has the capability for state caching and state interaction via server calls and signals.</li>
        <li>The simplified server communication [helper function "serverRender"] alongside the [helper function
            "myBurst"] allows for dynamic and quick interaction and availability.</li>
    </ul>
