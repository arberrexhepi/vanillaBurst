                    <p>
                        vanillaBurst is a JS packaging framework, usable as a standalone or plugin solution. It ensures
                        your
                        required files are always ready for the function you are working with, and for the DOM and
                        server
                        you
                        are
                        interacting with.
                    </p>

                        <li>
                            You can control the behavior of an existing JS project or create your own entirely! It
                            builds
                            and
                            prepares the project as <code>vanillaApp</code>.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            At its core, no additional helper functions actually need to be usedâ€¦ if all you need is JS
                            files
                            promised exactly where you need them for you to work with, then <code>config.js</code>,
                            <code>viewConfig.js</code>, and <code>view.js</code> is all that's necessary. In terms of
                            something
                            like
                            WordPress, you'll - ideally - never wonder why your clicks aren't firing again!

                            Beyond packing and load balancing of a project's files by endpoint (e.g., ?burst=home),
                            vanillaBurst
                            has
                            the capability for state caching and state interaction via server calls and signals.

                    <p>
                        From a system standpoint, vanillaBurst packs and readies your view routes as "landing" based on
                        the
                        following
                        setups of a developer using vanillaBurst: declaring "schemaParts" along with packages for any
                        given
                        "landing", declaring per "landing" - and/or "customFunction" <code>config.js</code>, and
                        creating
                        the
                        "landing" and optionally "customFunction" .js files which holds the code for the code that runs
                        on
                        "landing"
                        render completion.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Provided these tasks are complete, vanillaBurst will auto-run when the "landing" is in the
                        <code>window.location.path</code>.

                <section>
                    <h2>What are vanillaBurst configs?</h2>
                    <p>
                        From a system standpoint, configs are the required setups for vanillaBurst to auto-run and
                        balance
                        your
                        "landing". From a developer standpoint, configs are sets of directives that control the state
                        rendering
                        promise of vanillaBurst.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The benefit of configuring by vanillaBurst standards is that it provides a central observable
                        overview of how
                        a "landing", "customFunction" or the entirety of a "vanillaApp" operates. It works as a great
                        way to
                        plan a
                        "landing" and "customFunction" and all the while painlessly taking care of the rendering, based
                        on
                        your
                        plan!
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This approach allows a developer to focus on functionality rather than function file management
                        in
                        their
                        prepared .js files.

                            You can set up your data structure, access privileges by namespace, control render or pause
                            at
                            runtime
                            for load balancing, you can pass custom default properties to the schema via an
                            "originBurst"
                            object,
                            set up HTML and CSS calls to target for DOM Rendering to your "landing", and include
                            vendors.

                        <li>
                            The <code>config.js</code> allows for shared functions which can be set up as packages, but
                            it's
                            not
                            necessary because you can decide to place "customFunction" configs within the
                            <code>${landing}Config.js</code>. However, that's not recommended if you are planning a
                            larger
                            scale project.

                            For any future reconsiderations for a growing project, reconfiguring is super simple and the
                            vanillaApp will function as always if you set up the schemaParts[landing] with the new
                            configs
                            as
                            packages.

                            vanillaBurst is server agnostic, requiring nothing more than an environment that can run JS
                            and
                            has some
                            form of server level directive capabilities (e.g., Apache .htaccess).

                        <li>
                            vanillaBurst securely loads and sanitizes HTML files and CSS and makes calls based on config
                            available
                            endpoints via serverRender and can be configured as signals or a direct return.
