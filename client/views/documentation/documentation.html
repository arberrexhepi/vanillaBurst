        <p>vanillaApp is the core component of vanillaBurst framework.</p>

        <!-- INFO SET - What is vanillaBurst? -->
        <h2>What is vanillaBurst?</h2>
        <p>vanillaBurst is a JS packaging framework, usable as a standalone or plugin solution. It ensures your required
            files are always ready for the function you are working with, and for the DOM and server you are interacting
            with.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>You can control the behaviour of an existing JS project or create your own entirely! It builds and
                prepares the project as <code>vanillaApp</code>.</li>
            <li>At its core, no additional helper functions actually need to be usedâ€¦ if all you need is JS files
                promised exactly where you need them for you to work with, then <code>config.js</code>,
                <code>viewConfig.js</code>, and <code>view.js</code> is all that's necessary. In terms of something like
                Wordpress, you'll - ideallistically - never wonder why your clicks aren't firing again!

        <h2>What else can vanillaBurst do?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Beyond packing and load balancing of a project's files by endpoint i.e: ?burst=home, vanillaBurst has
                the capability for state caching and state interaction via server calls and signals.</li>
            <li>The simplified server communication <code>helper function "serverRender"</code> alongside the
                <code>helper function "myBurst"</code> allows for dynamic and quick interaction and availability.
            </li>

        <h2>How does vanillaBurst work? and how do I use it?</h2>
        <p>From a system standpoint, vanillaBurst packs and readies your view routes as "landing" based on the following
            setups of a developer using vanillaBurst: declaring "schemaParts" along with packages for any given
            "landing", declaring per "landing" - and/or "customFunction" <code>config.js</code>, and creating the
            "landing" and optionally "customFunction" .js files which holds the code for the code that runs on "landing"
            render completion.</p>
        <p>Provided these tasks are complete, vanillaBurst will autorun when the "landing" is in the
            <code>window.location.path</code>.
        </p>

            <!-- INFO SET - What are vanillaBurst configs? -->
            <h2>What are vanillaBurst configs?</h2>
            <p>From a system standpoint, configs are the required setups for vanillaBurst to auto run and balance your
                " landing". From a developer standpoint configs are sets of directives that control the state rendering
                promise of vanillaBurst.</p>
            <p>The benefit of configuring by vanillaBurst standards is that it provides a central observable
                overview of how
                a "landing", "customFunction" or the entirety of a "vanillaApp" operates. It works as a great way to
                plan a
                "landing" and "customFunction" and all the while painlessly taking care of the rendering, based on
                your
                plan!</p>
            <p>This approach allows a developer to focus on functionality rather than function file management in
                their
                readied .js files.</p>

            <!-- INFO SET - Config Features -->
            <h2>Config Features</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>You can setup your data structure, access privileges by namespace, control render or pause at
                    runtime
                    for load balancing, you can pass custom default properties to the schema via an "originBurst"
                    object,
                    setup html and css calls to target for DOM Rendering to your "landing", and include vendors.
                </li>
                <li>The <code>config.js</code> allows for share functions which can be setup as packages, but it's
                    not
                    necessary because you can decide to place "customFunction" configs within the
                    <code>${landing}Config.js</code>. But that's of course not recommended if you are planning a
                    larger
                    scale project.
                </li>
                <li>For any future reconsiderations for a growing project, reconfiguration is super simple and the
                    vanillaApp will function as always if you setup the schemaParts[landing] with the new configs as
                    packages.</li>

            <h2>Server Interaction</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>vanillaBurst is server agnostic, requiring nothing more than an environment that can run JS and
                    has some
                    form of server level directive capabilities (ie; apache .htaccess).</li>
                <li>vanillaBurst securely loads and sanitizes HTML files and CSS and make calls based on config
                    available
                    endpoints via serverRender and can be configured as signals or a direct return.</li>
                <li>Caching is promised by default for any of these files, including any html and css that you might
                    add to
                    the <code>viewConfig.js</code>.</li>

                <li>CustomFunctions are .js files that are promised at runtime. They are cached, and ran each time
                    the

                    within
                    the "landing" are ever run.</li>
                <li>Landing customFunctions, that have property dataSchema: {data: auto...} are also auto run, or

            <p>The code in this file can be purely vanilla JS, hence "vanillaBurst", can access helper functions, or
